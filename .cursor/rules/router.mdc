globs: *.router.js

always use the Endurance router instead of default express router. 
import routerBase from "endurance-core/lib/router.js"; and  const router = routerBase(); as a base for the router object in the file. Export it as follows :  export default router;

If an event should be raised : use the emitter lib as follows : 
import { emitter, eventTypes } from "endurance-core/lib/emitter.js";
And to emit an event :
emitter.emit(eventTypes.GENERATE_WEEKLY_TASKS);
eventTypes is an auto generated enum so you can create any eventType you like. 

Don't import files from another modules folder. Each module must stay independant in an Endurance project. 
Always use "import", it's a module package type.

Be carefull in the order of routes in a file. For exemple : 
router.get("/tasks/today", async (req, res) => {});
must be define before : 
router.get("/tasks/:id", async (req, res) => {});
Otherwise /tasks/today will be intercepted by /tasks/:id 

Router file name will be prepend to the API url. For example : 
task-list.router.js => http://localhost:4000/task-list/
